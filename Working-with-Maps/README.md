# Working with Maps

## Muenchian Grouping and Sorting in BizTalk Maps without losing Map functionalities
Project explaining how to use Muenchian Method to handle grouping and sorting in BizTalk Maps without losing Map functionalities. The Muenchian Method is a method developed by Steve Muench for performing grouping and sorting functionalities in a more efficient way using keys.

## How to create a Global Inline C# Function
The Scripting functoid enables you to use Inline Custom Script (C# .NET, JScript .NET, Visual Basic .NET, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) or XSLT Call Template) or call code from an external assembly at run time to perform operation otherwise not available

## How To Reuse Scripting Functoids with Inline C#
Inline scripts are convenient for custom code that you are unlikely to use elsewhere in your application or other maps. In addition to being convenient for one-time scripts, inline scripts are also useful for declaring global variables for use among a number of scripts and to use

## How to create a custom If-Then-Else Functoid
Sometimes I ask myself: Why is so hard to make a simple If-Then-Else Functoid, or even so painful to do an If-Then-Else operation, using BizTalk mapper?I don't mean to say that it is complicated, quite the opposite, is quite easy to make If…Then…Else statements using the Mapper.

## How to use Database Lookup Functoid
We can use the Database Lookup functoid to extract information from a database and store it as a Microsoft® ActiveX® Data Objects (ADO) recordset. This functoid requires four input parameters in the following order:
* Parameter 1: A value for which to search in the specified database, table, and column.
* Parameter 2: The full connection string for the database with a provider, machine name, database and authentication (an ActiveX Data Objects .NET (ADO.NET) connection string)
* Parameter 3: The name of the table in the database in which to search.
* Parameter 4: The name of the column in the table in which to search.

The functoid is actually quite simple to use, however, the main problem that developers face when they use it refers to the second parameter: the connection string.

in this sample we will address this issue and how can you handle.
