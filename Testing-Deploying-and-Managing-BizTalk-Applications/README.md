# Testing, Deploying and Managing BizTalk Applications

## BizTalk Server 2010: Using the Unit Testing Feature with Schemas and Maps
Testing is an important aspect of (BizTalk) application life cycle. Before a developer deploys his solution he needs to be confident that it will perform, and do the task(s) it is intended to do. It is a developer responsibility that he creates a robust application. Therefore he needs to unit test his BizTalk application artifacts before he deploys them for further testing.

A BizTalk developer has a couple of options when it comes to unit testing BizTalk artifacts. Testing of each can be done using a framework like BizUnit, or some of the other available tools offered through CodePlex, or Visual Studio. With BizTalk Server 2009 the unit test feature was introduced, which offered built-in developer support for testing schemas, maps and pipelines in Visual Studio.
